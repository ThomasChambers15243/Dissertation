{"p1": "You are given a non-negative floating-point number rounded to two decimal places celsius, that denotes the temperature in Celsius. You should convert Celsius into Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it as an array ans = [kelvin, fahrenheit]. Round the answers to two decimal places. Name the function P1", "p2": "Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', ' [' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type. Return a Boolean Value. Name the function P2", "p3": "Given a string of unknown length, find the longest, unbroken sequence of the same character. For example, \u201caaa\u201d is an unbroken sequence of length 3. In the string \u201casdjrrrraduu\u201d, \u201crrrr\u201d is the longest sequence of length 4. Return the length. Name the function P3.", "p4": "Given an array of strings, remove, if any, all duplicate elements. Duplicate elements are elements in the array that are evaluated as the same, so \u201cJohn\u201d == \u201cJohn\u201d but \u201csam\u201d \u2260 \u201cSam\u201d and \u201cJohn\u201d \u2260 \u201cSam\u201d.

Duplicates can be in either order next to each other. Name the function P5", "p6": "Given two arrays of strings, combine them into one sorted array, with the shortest length string at index 0 and the longest length string at the last index. If two strings are the same length, sum up each string\u2019s characters\u2019 ASCII value, and use that total, inserting the smallest first. Return the new array. Name the function P6."}
